Think Computationally
=====================

This git repository holds some material that we will use during the Physics
Honours Kickoff module **Think Computationally**.

To prepare for the module, please make sure that you can (still) run Python
scripts on your computer, and [install git]. Maybe your favourite editor has
support for git.

During the kickoff module, we will explore what you can find in this repository,
discuss the content and try to improve it.
